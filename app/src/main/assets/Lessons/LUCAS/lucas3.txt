Lucas bundled up in his warmest coat, mittens, and scarf. He was ready to explore the winter wonderland. Outside, he saw a snowman with a bright orange carrot nose. The snowman had stick arms and a purple hat. It was surrounded by giggling kids. They were all having a great time building snow forts and making snow angels.
